# Learnable_Python_Chess

This was created after I wanted to learn how to program chess in Python.
I found there weren't many good resources which taught me how to program chess in Python.
The best one I found was Simple Python Chess (https://github.com/liudmil-mitev/Simple-Python-Chess), but this was created for Python 2.5+, and it's not been updated since.

So I created what I wanted.
I used Simple Python Chess as inspiration, but I changed what I wanted to in an effort to create a more readable program.

I'm new to programming in general, although I am somewhat confident in my Python, so if you have any suggestions, comments, or such, feel free to email me at BarrettRoss23@gmail.com.
I hope this can help you.
