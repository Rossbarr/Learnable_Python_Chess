# Learnable Python Chess

Learnable Python Chess is a github repository designed to showcase a chess in Python program that aims to teach Python programmers how to create a chess application.

While beginning to learn to program, a good way to learn is to create and finish projects. A chess project is as good as any other.

I found there weren't many good resources which I could use to learn how to program chess in Python.
The best one I found was Simple Python Chess (https://github.com/liudmil-mitev/Simple-Python-Chess), but this was created for Python 2.5+, and it's not been updated since.

So I created what I wanted.
I used Simple Python Chess as inspiration, but I changed what I wanted to in an effort to create a more readable and understandable program.

I'm new to programming in general, although I am somewhat confident in my Python, so if you have any suggestions, comments, or such, feel free to email me at BarrettRoss23@gmail.com.
I hope this can help you.

## Requirements
This Chess Program uses Python 3.8, although I'm fairly certain it'll work on any Python 3.
It uses only packages in the standard library, most importantly numpy and tkinter.
